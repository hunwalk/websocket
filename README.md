# Yii2 [WebSocketServer](/WebSocketServer.php)

#### This package is a fixed and reduced version of the original yii2-websocket which is at the time is not maintained.
#### You can find the original repository here: https://github.com/consik/yii2-websocket

I made these changes simply, because i will need this in another project.
I cannot provide documentation yet, there are quite a few changes.
Your only option is to read the code yourself.
There may be some kind of docs here in the future.

Because of an ongoing project, you can expect this repo to be maintained by me.

Also, the command functionality has been removed, because i found it unsafe to use, and I'm
going to have a different approach implementing that inside my project.
